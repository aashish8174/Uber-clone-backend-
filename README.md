This project is a web-based transportation application that includes both frontend and backend components. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for three types of users: admins, customers, and drivers. The backend handles data processing, user authentication, ride management, and data storage.

Frontend
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a landing page where users can select their role and get redirected to the appropriate page. Each user type (admin, customer, driver) has a dedicated interface with specific functionalities.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the web pages to make them visually appealing.
JavaScript: For client-side scripting to handle user interactions and dynamic content.
User Interfaces
Landing Page (index.html):

A simple interface with buttons to select the user role (Admin, Customer, Driver).
Redirection to the respective pages based on user selection.
Admin Page (admin.html):

Dashboard for managing the application.
Features for managing users, drivers, viewing reports, and configuring settings.
Customer Page (customer.html):

Interface to book rides by entering pickup and dropoff locations.
View booking history and ride status.
Driver Page (driver.html):

Interface to manage current rides.
Accept or decline ride requests and view ride details.
Backend
The backend is developed using a server-side technology (such as Node.js, Python with Flask or Django, Java with Spring Boot, etc.) and connects to a database to store and manage data.

Technologies Used
Server-side Language: Node.js (for example)
Framework: Express.js (for Node.js) or Flask/Django (for Python) or Spring Boot (for Java)
Database: MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication
API Development: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend
Features
User Management:

Registration and login for admins, customers, and drivers.
Profile management and user roles assignment.
Ride Management:

Booking, updating, and cancelling rides.
Managing ride statuses and driver assignments.
Data Storage:

Persistent storage of user information, ride details, and other relevant data in a database.
Reporting:

Generating reports for admins to monitor system performance, user activities, and financial metrics.
Workflow
User Interaction:

Users interact with the frontend through a web browser.
The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend for data retrieval and updates.
Backend Processing:

The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and applies business logic.
Responses are sent back to the frontend to update the UI accordingly.
Data Management:

All data related to users, rides, and system activities are stored in the database.
The backend ensures data integrity and security.
